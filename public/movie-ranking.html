<h1>One of the best Animes of ALL TIME by davie10863</h1>

<h2>These are my the Top 3</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Classroom of the Elite</h3>
<p>This anime is a psychological and thriller genre. 
The main character is overpowered, smart, and more laid back; tries to hide his 
abilities and pulls strings behind the scenes. This anime also has some great 
characters like one of the protagonist Ryuuen (A big menace).</p>

<h3>My Teen Romantic Comedy (Oregairu)</h3>
<p>Another banger. This anime is about a group of loners starting with the main character
Hachiman Hikigaya(also referred as 8man), a self depricating and pragmatic person. 
The other lead characters are 2 beatiful female characters Yukino Yukinoshita, 
and Yui Yuigahama. A lot of drama and romance is in this anime, 
also a lot of subtle things where you have to read between the line.</p>

<h3>Evangelion</h3>
<p>This anime series explores the experiences and emotions of teenagers who pilot 
evangelions and members of Nerv as they try to prevent these waves of monsters
(known as angesl) causing cataclysms. This anime has drama, emotions, romance, 
inappropiate things, and a lot of sadness and despair. The end will leave you 
confused. Additionally, the soundtrack is amazing.</p>
