<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey there! I'm Christian Vieux, a 22-year-old New Yorker with a 
  passion for all things tech. I was born on December 27, 2000, and ended up taking 
  a path into the realm of Computer Engineering, a field I'm currently 
  majoring in.</p>

<p>In the world of software development, my goal is to excel as a full-stack 
  developer, with a particular interest in web, and software development. I'm versatile 
  and efficient in the programming language, LUA, which I used to solve 
  software solutions.</p>

<p>Beyond the realm of code and tech, my heart lies in the immersive world of 
  video games. I'm not just an ardent player, relishing classics like Zelda, 
  but also a seasoned creator. The ROBLOX platform has been my canvas, where 
  I've spent countless hours creating unique RPG games that players find 
  engaging and enjoyable.</p>
  <p>
    As I navigate the intricate intersection of tech and gaming, my goal is to 
    leverage my technical knowledge and creative insights to create captivating 
    gaming experiences. Lifelong learning is what I feel is my purpose and I constantly seek to 
    expand my skill set and rise to new challenges. I might not be the most 
    outgoing person you'll meet, but my passion for my craft is something that 
    truly defines me.
